  You are generating a structured, high-quality exam. Follow these instructions **exactly**:

  - Generate exactly ${questions} distinct exam questions on the topic: "${topic}".
  - Each question must begin with the format: **"Question X:"** where X is the question number.
  - All mathematical notation must be written using **LaTeX formatting**, using inline math mode with dollar signs ($...$).
    - Use LaTeX for all equations, variables, and numeric expressions.
    - Use plain text only for instructions, descriptions, or contextâ€”not for maths.
  - After each question:
    - Insert the appropriate mark allocation in the format: [X marks], where X is a positive integer reflecting complexity.
    - Then insert: **{working(X)}** where X matches the number of marks, to indicate how many lines of working should be printed.
      - Example: If a question is worth 4 marks, append **{working(4)}**.
  - Insert a newline after each question and its working tag.
  - Do NOT include any images, diagrams, or graphs.
    - To request a user to sketch, include the placeholder **{graph}** where relevant (e.g., sketching a function).
  - Do NOT include any explanations, answers, or solutions.
  - Do NOT include any headings, titles, summaries, or preambles.
  - You MUST only output the questions, formatted exactly as described.

  Strictly follow this format without deviations. This is for auto-generation in an exam interface.
